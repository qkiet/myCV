            \begin{itemize}
                \item Implement end-to-end automation test for many features of Axon products like Axon Body 3 or Axon Body 4
                \item Improve and expand in-house automation test framework
                \item Maintain Axon's complex application layer
            \end{itemize}
        }{
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Able to fake a RFID scan app in order to perform automation test that use RFID scan app. This problem is solved thanks to browser developer tools, which I am able to extract API and its data
                \item Add to automation test framework Multi-Authentication Factor (MFA) utility to test MFA feature. This problem is solved thanks to, again, browser developer tools and investigation into how MFA really works
                \item Add a sub-command that allows developer to capture what text fields and values LCD is currently display. This feature opens new possibility for automation test because automation test now can check the texts on LCD
                \item Help team move forward by fixing a C++ unit test that weirdly passed in local environment but failed when run in Jenkins environment (spoiler alert: \textit{uninitialized mutex})
                \item Fix a complex issues that involves a lot of processes and happens ocassionally. This problem is interesting because it teaches me how fragile complex software can be and technique to lessen the chance of causing regression.

                \item Pioneer in deeply investigate into various Android platform development topics, most notably are: build system, HAL and VHAL, customized SDK, platform configuration, porting 3rd party library, making digital cluster app. All of this investigation are made into comprehensive documents for team.
                \item Using knowledge of Android build system to port 3rd party library OpenDDS to AOSP, which does not exist in AOSP.
                \item Using knowledge of HAL and VHAL + making digital cluster app to make a POC digital cluster app, whose data is connected to a VHAL back-end service

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Support implementing AUTOSAR various module like DET and DEM
                \item Develop additional complex driver in order to bring up features like WiFi
            \end{itemize}
        }{
            \begin{itemize}
                \item Fix an buffer overflow bug: sometimes UART data transmitting from one ECU to another is dropped unexpectedly. Turns out the receive handling doing too much processing (like checksum comparision) that leads to data loss. Counter this issue by forwarding UART data directly to a circular queue for later processing.
                \item Develop a unique WiFi solution for ION's ECU which does not have built-in WiFi module but have external ESP-32 module. This is accomplished by porting ESP Hosted into ECU (a complex device driver CDD) and ESP-32 module. A challenge is: I must find the workaround for mutex because ESP Hosted in MCU side uses a lot of mutex but platform realtime OS OSEK does not support mutex.
                \item Develop a CDD called Wifi Manager to manage Wi-Fi connection. This driver is implemented by using my own finite state machine implementation and leveraging above Wi-Fi driver.
                \item Develop a CDD called LTE driver to seamlessly communicate with LTE module to make HTTP request or using built-in MQTT AT command
                \item Develop a CDD called MQTT driver that manage MQTT connection, get published data and push data. This MQTT driver is designed to be used by multiple transport: by either Wi-Fi or LTE

\textbf{\textit{Thesis:}} Develop a new \textbf{lightweight security protocol} that used for communication between Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and computer software. This security protocol features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encrypted transmitted messages with \textbf{non-repeat encrypt key}. Encrypt algorithm using \textbf{AES-CTR-128 for utilizing parallel computation}, thus reduce computation time.
    \item Detect unauthorized modification of incoming messages using \textbf{Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)}.
    \item \textbf{Customized encrypt key exchange protocol} features 3-way handshake key exchange and emergency procedure to restore encrypt key for both sides in case of corrupted message.
\end{itemize}
Implementation of this protocol including utilizing \textbf{lwIP + FreeRTOS} on PDU's firmware and \textbf{Visual C++} on computer host software.\\
