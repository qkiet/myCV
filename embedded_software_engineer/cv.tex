\begin{itemize}
     \item Coordinate with hardware team for \textbf{schematic revision and recommendation} to make sure defined features are functional
     \item \textbf{Develop, monitor and adjust firmware development plan} to make sure projects meet its deadline 
     \item \textbf{Manage project documentation database} to make sure documentation database is easy to navigate and new recruits can understand project structure
     \item Customize \textbf{MEC1428 (a M14K core MCU)} source code to aid CPU power sequence and control \& monitor platform's hardware
     \item \textbf{Customize BIOS}, which uses {\bf Slim bootloader} framework, to make sure platform is functional as expected. Customization include \textbf{reconfigure GPIO}, \textbf{configure SoC supported features} and customize \textbf{ACPI firmware} (to make sure Windows driver recognize and configure hardware)
     \item Debug prototypes using following methods: \textbf{logs} produced from BIOS; probing \textbf{power \& data signals} using \textit{multimeter, oscilloscope and logic analyzer}; using \textbf{Windows tools} to inspect hardware communication
     \item \textbf{Work closely with suppliers} for firmware support and request additional tools \& documents

{\bf University of Technology Ho Chi Minh City} \hfill {\em 08/2015 - 2021} 
\\ Electronics - Telecommunications Engineering\hfill { GPA: 7.33/10 }


\textbf{\textit{Thesis:}} Develop a new \textbf{lightweight security protocol} that used for communication between Power Distribution Unit (PDU) and computer software. This security protocol features:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Encrypted transmitted messages with \textbf{non-repeat encrypt key}. Encrypt algorithm using \textbf{AES-CTR-128 for utilizing parallel computation}, thus reduce computation time.
    \item Detect unauthorized modification of incoming messages using \textbf{Hash-based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)}.
    \item \textbf{Customized encrypt key exchange protocol} features 3-way handshake key exchange and emergency procedure to restore encrypt key for both sides in case of corrupted message.
\end{itemize}
Implementation of this protocol including utilizing \textbf{lwIP + FreeRTOS} on PDU's firmware and \textbf{Visual C++} on computer host software.\\
